1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:16,528
good morning everybody

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:19,439
today is April 8th and the shutdown the

3
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:22,800
lockdown due to the spread of the corona

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,629
virus continues and according to some

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,839
statistics that I was able to gather

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:33,200
this morning here in the United States

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:36,710
there so far been 402 thousand cases of

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:42,059
people infected with the virus and

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:45,750
roughly 13,000 deaths and in the United

10
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:48,439
in New York State as of yesterday there

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,710
have been five thousand and five hundred

12
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:55,619
deaths now we have to remember that the

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,679
these deaths are not merely abstract

14
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:02,250
statistics but these represent the

15
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:05,790
passing out of this life of real human

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,030
beings these were people with lives just

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,729
like our own people have to had hoped to

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,000
have a long lifespan who had hoped for

19
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,900
good health who had their projects their

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,938
wishes their hopes their aspirations

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,430
people who had family members who love

22
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,779
them and cherish them who had friends

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,740
who also loved them and cherish them and

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:34,739
now as this terrible virus spreads it

25
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:38,819
robs the world of each of these people

26
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:41,489
and so we should call them to mind with

27
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:45,419
thoughts of sympathy particularly for

28
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:47,789
their friends and relatives and I also

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,859
hope that everybody who is watching this

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:59,909
is maintaining good health through this

31
00:01:52,859 --> 00:02:02,640
very trying period very severe tests of

32
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,490
our patience of a determination of our

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,250
equanimity

34
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:09,368
and it's particularly I want to

35
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,669
emphasize again that it's particularly

36
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:16,520
important to adhere strictly to the

37
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:19,639
guidelines lay down by the health

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,540
authorities to observe what is called

39
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,879
social distant distancing to remain in

40
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:29,568
one's place of residence to the base

41
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:34,189
best of one's ability to avoid meeting

42
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:38,149
with people out in groups and to always

43
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:41,900
wash one's hands with soap to wash them

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:47,989
for 20 seconds to avoid touching the

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:51,019
face with one's hands and to try to

46
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:55,180
remain fixed within one's place of

47
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,180
residence to the best of one's ability

48
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:01,459
today I want to speak about two

49
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,848
particular problems that arise as we are

50
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:09,939
observing the lockdown as we are

51
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:09,939
observing these stay at home quarters

52
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:19,609
one of the problems arises when we're

53
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,409
staying at home in a place in which

54
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:25,600
there are several other people our

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:29,269
family members or friends or roommates

56
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,280
the other problem is a problem that

57
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,180
arises when we are observing the

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,849
lockdown or stay at home alone so each

59
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,030
of these conditions has its own set of

60
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:44,329
problems and I want to see what we can

61
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,090
find within the Buddhist teachings and

62
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:50,150
Buddhist practice that can help us deal

63
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,000
with each of these challenges first

64
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,170
comes the challenge of staying in a

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,259
fixed residence with other people

66
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:02,509
family members roommates friends now

67
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:05,090
what happens under these conditions is

68
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:07,750
when one is living in close association

69
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,879
with others close

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,599
in close quarters with others rubbing

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,500
elbows with others throughout the day

72
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:21,290
without any chance to break out and to

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,240
go off on one's own it tends to give

74
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:28,069
rise to feelings of tension hostility

75
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,550
irritation annoyance and this could lead

76
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:34,129
to unpleasant incidents outbreaks of

77
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,040
violent speech abusive and aggressive

78
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:40,990
speech was sometimes in some cases even

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,510
to physical violence so how can we avoid

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,199
letting the crammed conditions that

81
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:51,129
we're observing great uh nerves and

82
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:55,310
become a condition for the arising of

83
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:57,649
disagreeable behavior okay there are

84
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,230
several measures that we might draw upon

85
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:04,359
first certain practices that we could

86
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:08,319
undertake one practice that's useful is

87
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,360
for everybody who is living in the same

88
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,089
residence the same facility at the

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,180
beginning of the active day perhaps at

90
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,399
breakfast time or after breakfast to get

91
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,449
together of course observing a certain

92
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:25,849
distance between yourselves but sitting

93
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,250
around the table or in the same room a

94
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,879
chairs place the comfortable distance

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,310
apart and make the determination each

96
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,409
one makes the determination together

97
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,259
that no matter what happens in the

98
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:45,760
course of the day one is going to remain

99
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:49,959
patient and peaceful and not allow this

100
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,810
these crammed conditions to give rise to

101
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:57,469
outbursts of angry speech or of

102
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,589
aggressive behavior so when one makes

103
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,500
that determination everybody making the

104
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:07,279
pledge to follow those guidelines it

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,980
acts on a curb on one's behavior

106
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,489
so naturally feelings of irritation

107
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:16,400
might arise feelings of annoyance

108
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,350
displeasure with some of your roommates

109
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,000
family members roommates for friends

110
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,110
but when those feelings of irritation

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,589
and annoyance arise you recognize them

112
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,710
for what they are and you recall the

113
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:35,689
pledge the resolution that you all made

114
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:39,659
together and then you make an effort to

115
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:43,290
prevent that annoyance from erupting in

116
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,240
the form of disagreeable conduct and so

117
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,040
one of the instruments that one can use

118
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,400
to control the irritation is the

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,980
practice of mindfulness and in this case

120
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,879
would be a kind of cheat Canopus onna an

121
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,930
exercise of contemplation of the mind or

122
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:07,079
perhaps a form of Domino plus in a

123
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,540
contemplation of mental factors in this

124
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,000
case the mental factor of ill will

125
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,360
so rather than letting that irritation

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,300
and annoyance govern the mind and

127
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,150
control and X one's behavior and express

128
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,329
itself in one's behavior one notes the

129
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:27,929
state of mind irritation annoyance

130
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:31,050
ill-will and then one can either observe

131
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,720
the state of mind or one makes until it

132
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,170
fades away and disappears or one can

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,500
make an active effort to suppress it and

134
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:45,870
in any case one should control one's

135
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:49,740
behavior a more direct antidote is to

136
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,379
bring up the feeling of loving kindness

137
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,629
towards the people who are causing the

138
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,740
irritation so instead of letting the

139
00:07:54,629 --> 00:08:01,379
angry resentful thoughts continue to run

140
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,530
through the mind as that irritation

141
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:08,490
arises you bring forth the thought that

142
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:11,819
we are all living under the same

143
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,910
conditions these conditions might be

144
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,370
difficult for me but they might also be

145
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:21,120
difficult for the other person and we

146
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,660
are all observing these regulations this

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,230
stay-at-home practice in order to

148
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:32,278
protect ourselves from contracting the

149
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:34,110
disease caused by the virus

150
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,019
and so you would think that we are all

151
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,209
vulnerable to this illness and in this

152
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,698
way one generates a feeling of loving

153
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:44,818
kindness towards everybody in one's

154
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:49,620
household generating the wish may they

155
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:53,219
all be well may they all be happy may

156
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,409
they all be safe may they all be healthy

157
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,490
and if there's one person in particular

158
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:02,159
that's causing the irritation you can

159
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,438
direct that contemplation towards the

160
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,219
person who's responsible for the

161
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:09,778
irritation so this is a kind of practice

162
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,100
that one could who are actually several

163
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:18,389
practices simple mindful observation of

164
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:21,808
the mind the more forceful suppression

165
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:25,230
and elimination of the angry resentful

166
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:28,350
thoughts and the application of the

167
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,990
antidote the antidote in this case being

168
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,808
loving-kindness so these are antidotes

169
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:37,558
that one can apply in the course of the

170
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:40,860
day then what one could do at some point

171
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:43,308
in the evening that everybody gets

172
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,308
together everybody who's living together

173
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:50,188
comes together meets together again with

174
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:53,490
sufficient distance between you and you

175
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:57,120
each offer to all the members of the

176
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,938
group an apology for any kind of

177
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,688
unwholesome behavior that one has

178
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:06,088
indulged in or any kind of unwholesome

179
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:08,099
thoughts that might have arisen towards

180
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,259
the others in the course of the day

181
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,959
this is a common practice within the

182
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,120
Buddhist monastic community generally

183
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,469
when one has at certain occasions when

184
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,409
we have the evening recitation each

185
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,439
member of the monastic community will

186
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:29,990
especially towards the elders will make

187
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:33,629
the determination go Casavant ami ponte

188
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:36,389
de vara taina cotton sobbing achayan

189
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:40,769
committed may Ponte and oh come on

190
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:42,379
Obadiah so he'll say I pay homage to you

191
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,019
venerable one

192
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:48,080
if I have committed any transgressions

193
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:52,039
through the three doors of action so

194
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:55,509
body speech or mind let the venerable

195
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,039
one pardon me out of compassion for me

196
00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:01,220
so this doesn't have to be applied only

197
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,559
by monks but as family members get

198
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,370
together each one could say to the

199
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:10,369
others I address you all I have respect

200
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,629
and affection for you all and if I have

201
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:17,870
behaved wrongly in any way through body

202
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:18,429
through speech also a thought please all

203
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,539
of you

204
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:26,569
pardon me recognize my fault my

205
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:31,309
transgression and let us turn over and

206
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,230
make a better start tomorrow so these

207
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:35,659
are some of techniques that one could

208
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,500
use when living together with others

209
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:42,679
under confined conditions that tend to

210
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,519
give rise to irritation annoyance

211
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:52,879
friction friction that might explode in

212
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:55,819
aggressive speech or bodily behavior the

213
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,429
other type of condition under which

214
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:03,680
people might be living which causes

215
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:05,539
problems and that is living alone this

216
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,429
is for people who don't have family

217
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,769
members don't have friends living with

218
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:13,549
them but they're living in an apartment

219
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:16,819
to room by themselves and don't have the

220
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:19,909
opportunity to socialize with others and

221
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:26,150
they might feel the oppression of

222
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:30,230
loneliness isolation alienation and this

223
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:32,779
can cause the ejection irritation they

224
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,889
might turn it inward upon themselves and

225
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:38,319
started indulging in thoughts of self

226
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:41,529
depreciation

227
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,530
and this could even lead to deep

228
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:48,189
depression feeling of being completely

229
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:51,490
isolated from others so how do we deal

230
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:54,310
with a condition like this again there

231
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,950
are several tools that the buddhadharma

232
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:59,099
gives us well first even before turning

233
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,890
to the Buddha Dhamma is a very practical

234
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:06,340
you know ordinary way in which we can

235
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:11,259
break out of that cage of isolation and

236
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:14,800
loneliness living in this modern time we

237
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:18,789
have access to electronic means of

238
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:22,049
communication we can use the telephone

239
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:26,349
to call our friends or family members

240
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:29,639
speak to them ask how they are you know

241
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,690
express our good wishes for them and

242
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,689
particularly there might be people that

243
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,550
like family members friends that we

244
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,250
haven't communicated with for a long

245
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:42,069
time but now when we're all living under

246
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,620
these very demanding conditions this

247
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:48,129
might be the time to contact them again

248
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,129
and to renew old acquaintances and to

249
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:53,980
express your concern for your family

250
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:57,279
members for your friends even some

251
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,330
colleagues or acquaintances and through

252
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,909
the means of the telephone sky zoom or

253
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,460
other means of communication you can

254
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:09,100
establish contact with them communicate

255
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,889
with them and because we're all living

256
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,500
under Fairey challenging conditions this

257
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,210
provides the opportunity for

258
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,279
establishing deeper relationships

259
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,769
whereas when we're living under normal

260
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,079
conditions our contacts our

261
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,909
relationships might be rather

262
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,550
superficial and not really touching the

263
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:30,939
very depths of our being but when we are

264
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:34,509
all really staring in the face of the

265
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,450
debilitating illness even an illness

266
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:39,879
which can turn lethal and take lives

267
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,850
this becomes the chance for us to

268
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:47,039
establish much deeper

269
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:50,379
much more personal more intimate

270
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,139
relationships with our family members

271
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:54,879
and friends and so even though we might

272
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,699
be living physically alone

273
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,879
but through telephone Skype zoom or

274
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:04,180
other means we can break out of our

275
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:09,370
loneliness and establish communications

276
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:12,039
with others but also now coming within

277
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:17,169
the domain of the buddhadharma we should

278
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:18,819
see the conditions of confinement and

279
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:21,099
stay at home

280
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,640
orders under which we're living to be a

281
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:28,600
precious opportunity an opportunity to

282
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:32,730
go deeper inside through the cultivation

283
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:36,509
of the practices of the buddha dhamma

284
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:41,019
particularly the practice of Bhavana

285
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:42,970
meditation the buddha says that he this

286
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:45,759
is shortly before he passed away he

287
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:50,379
instructed his disciples the monastic

288
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,319
disciples to dwell as islands unto

289
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:56,649
themselves

290
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,610
refuges unto themselves taking no other

291
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:03,370
island no other refuge and what is that

292
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:07,740
island what is that refuge if Buddha s

293
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:11,200
as disciples to rely upon it is the four

294
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,649
foundations of mindfulness so when we

295
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,740
take up the practice of developing the

296
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:20,799
four foundations of mindfulness which

297
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,340
means it affects the systematic formal

298
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:28,329
methodical practice of meditation then

299
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:34,660
we see the chance to live in solitude to

300
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:37,240
be staying alone to be as a kind of

301
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:40,019
liberation from our obligations to

302
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,590
others and a chance to look more deeply

303
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:49,059
inside to dwell deep inside ourselves

304
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:53,040
and to experience a peace a joy a

305
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:56,699
happiness that is only possible when

306
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:59,639
dwelling inwardly in solitude

307
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,890
and even when can join if one doesn't

308
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,909
want to practice meditation exclusively

309
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,309
by oneself

310
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:09,059
there are various opportunities over the

311
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:11,970
Internet to join meditation groups or

312
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:16,649
Dhamma discussion groups what to listen

313
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:21,680
to Dhamma discourses and so one could be

314
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:24,690
practicing alone but in communic

315
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,019
communion with others in association

316
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:30,480
with others and as one comes to dwell

317
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:34,799
was in through the practice of

318
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,089
meditation then one comes to enjoy the

319
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:42,149
solitude to cherish it and this becomes

320
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:46,049
a kind of ideal way of dwelling sits

321
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:49,710
well fixed within the body to dwell with

322
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:55,980
in one's own feelings to dwell within

323
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:58,500
one's mind descending into deeper more

324
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,589
peaceful more tranquil states of mind

325
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,609
and to come to know and to understand

326
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:08,669
more clearly the contents the workings

327
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:11,759
the operation of one's mind and so in

328
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:17,580
this way one finds dwelling in solitude

329
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:22,710
to be a precious opportunity to discover

330
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:26,699
the peace the joy of was called the make

331
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:32,009
amaz suka the Bliss of renunciation the

332
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:35,519
Bliss of solitude and while we dwell in

333
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:39,259
solitude through our practice we could

334
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,259
develop at a deep level

335
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:45,730
communion with others through the

336
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:49,849
practice especially the development of

337
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,380
meta and Karuna loving-kindness and

338
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:54,949
compassion

339
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:59,720
so through loving-kindness we generate

340
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:02,660
we spread our mind out over first our

341
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,480
place of residence the building in which

342
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,650
we're living in my case the monastery

343
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,069
where I'm living

344
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:13,430
could be your apartment building your

345
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:16,069
your street your neighbourhood extending

346
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,880
to everyone the wish that they might be

347
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:22,009
well happy and safe and then you spread

348
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,090
that mind of loving kindness further

349
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:29,480
throughout the whole country wishing all

350
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:32,209
the people in the u.s. be well happy and

351
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,630
safe and then extended to the whole

352
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:40,750
world wishing that everyone in the world

353
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:44,360
is well happy safe and able to preserve

354
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,940
good health so that is the practice of

355
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:50,029
loving kindness and then when you think

356
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:53,539
about the people who are fallen ill who

357
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:56,839
are suffering from the virus who might

358
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:01,909
be lying in a hospital bed attended by

359
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:04,519
nurses having difficulty breathing and

360
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:07,160
you think about the relatives who are

361
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:10,220
looking after them anxiously then you

362
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,380
develop the mind of compassion thinking

363
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,980
of all the people afflicted with

364
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:19,430
suffering and generate the wish they all

365
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,950
be free from suffering and then one

366
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,970
could bring to mind all of the people

367
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,190
who are sacrificing their own time even

368
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:32,360
their own health and even putting their

369
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,630
own life on the line to serve others to

370
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,419
serve complete strangers we think of the

371
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:41,090
doctors the nurses the other hospital

372
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,100
staff the service workers and the

373
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:46,759
different service industries who are

374
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:49,099
working to keep the economy running now

375
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:52,460
we could generate towards them a mind of

376
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:53,189
great appreciation this would be a kind

377
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,549
of

378
00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:02,279
mudita altruistic joy rejoicing in their

379
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:05,769
dedication the selfless service their

380
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:08,529
activities even self sacrificial

381
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:12,759
activities putting their health and

382
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:16,480
well-being at risk to serve others and

383
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:19,420
we rejoice and in in their activities

384
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,230
and this way we generate a very pure

385
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,029
wholesome mind of altruistic joy and so

386
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,440
in this way through loving kindness

387
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:30,730
compassion and altruistic joy even when

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,340
we're living alone

389
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:38,910
we are stablishing very deep very strong

390
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:41,889
powerful connections with others

391
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:46,180
connections which are founded upon the

392
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:49,600
fact that our own life even though we

393
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:53,500
might feel lonely and isolated but never

394
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:57,250
alone never isolated but we live within

395
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:01,539
this very intricate infinitely complex

396
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:03,880
web of mutual dependencies and so by

397
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:06,789
generating loving kindness and

398
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:11,110
compassion and altruistic joy we are

399
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:14,980
sending our mental waves out along the

400
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:19,049
fibers of these Nets of relationships

401
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:24,220
and we are strengthening the well-being

402
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:28,839
the vibrancy the Solidarity of the whole

403
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,680
and this should give us a reason to be

404
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:34,149
joyful

405
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,150
even in our solitude okay with this I

406
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,180
will end this short presentation today

407
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,420
